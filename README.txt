Hi, This is the script I worked on for my final BOOTCON project. All of the code is original although some parts of the original design were inspired by W J Pearce's YouTube video "Build a password manager" I highly recommened beginners check that video out.

For this program to work you need all included files in the same directory as main.py with the same name. login.csv must have a username and a password stored in a sha256 hash as comma-separated values for this to work. You can also edit this from the "executive controls section of the program if you leave an empty login.
